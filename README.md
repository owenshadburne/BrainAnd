# BrainAnd

An intense puzzle game based on my own esoteric programming language. Developed with Unity, this project served as an inspiration for a meeting I later gave at my school's Computer Science Club. Created my Junior year of High School as a personal project. Hosted on [itch.io](https://cubetures.itch.io/brainand).
